## The Wall

Simple app for Users to create Posts on a "wall", and read each other's Posts.

Node/Express-based, using EJS as the view engine and stock Bootstrap for styling. Sequelize for interacting with the PostgreSQL database.

There are some minimal field validations and error messages when creating a new Post.

Things to be added or bettered:

* User model, and Authentication for Users
* User Authorizations and Permissions for CRUD on Posts
* The rest of the CRUD actions for Posts
* Accessiblity updates for views
* "flash" messaging
* Refactoring for a more module-based pattern
